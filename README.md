# Tracer

Tracer is a desktop application which tracks users' mouse behaviors through a series of button presses.

## Description

Tracer is an application developed to capture users' mouse behaviors by having them click on a series of targets. Target locations are generated randomly for each session and have an associated sequence code. This code can be copied and pasted into the application in order to reproduce target locations so as to compare different users' behaviors in the same session. Mouse strokes are stored in an online database for use with our supplementary behavioral analysis tools.

## Motivation

Tracer is being developed alongside a suite of human-computer interaction research modules funded by Ore Technical Labs. All mouse strokes captured during any given session are uploaded to a database for analysis.

## Instructions
