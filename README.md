# Tracer

Tracer is an application developed to capture users' mouse behaviors by having them click on a series of targets. Target locations are generated randomly for each session and have an associated sequence code. This code can be copied and pasted into the application in order to reproduce target locations so as to compare different users' behaviors in the same session. 

## Motivation

Tracer is being developed alongside a suite of human-computer interaction research modules funded by Ore Technical Labs. All mouse strokes captured during any session are uploaded to a database for analysis.
